## Overview ##

We've added support for the NLog appender. This allows you to leverage your current investment in NLog, but leverage the power and flexibility that comes with the ReflectInsight viewer. You can view your NLog messages in real-time, in a rich viewer that allows you to filter out and search for what really matters to you.

The NLog extension supports v2.0.0.2. However if you need to support an older version, then you will need to download the ReflectInsight Logging Extensions Library from GitHub. You can then reference and rebuild the extension against your a specific release of the NLog dll. (Note: if you use the Nuget Package, the update to the latest version of NLog will be automatic).

## Benefits of ReflectInsight Extensions ##

The benefits to using the Insight Extensions is that you can easily and quickly add them to your applicable with little effort and then use the ReflectInsight Viewer to view your logging in real-time, allowing you to filter, search, navigate and see the details of your logged messages.
